/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the SmartGas Guardian system.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The document ID is the user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores devices owned by each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by each device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data (profile, devices, alerts).
 * - Listing the root collection is denied to all users.
 * - All write operations require an authenticated user.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during prototyping but critical relational fields (e.g., userId) are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Alert` entity includes a `userId` field to simplify security rules and avoid expensive queries.
