/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 * access their own data, including user profiles, devices, and alerts. No user data
 * is publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The {userId} MUST match the
 *   authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts for a specific
 *   device owned by a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations require authentication and ownership validation.
 * - The 'userId' field is denormalized onto the Device and Alert documents to allow simple,
 *   performant security rules without requiring additional reads.
