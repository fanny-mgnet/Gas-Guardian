/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 * including profile information, devices, and alerts. Root-level listing of collections is disallowed.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores devices owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by a specific device.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Devices and alerts are strictly scoped to their owning user and device.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - The `Alert` entity contains a `userId` field to simplify security rules and avoid costly `get()` operations
 *   when checking user ownership.
