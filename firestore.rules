/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian
 * @description This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model that allows open device registration but restricts modifications to authenticated users or the device itself. User data is protected behind owner-only access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information. Device registration is open, but updates are restricted.
 * - /devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts associated with a device. Accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user information. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Device registration is open to all, simulating device self-registration.
 * - Device updates are restricted to authenticated users.
 * - User data is strictly private (owner-only access).
 * - Listing of devices is open to all.
 * - Listing of alerts is restricted to authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Alerts include the `deviceId` field to allow direct authorization checks without needing to query the parent device document.
