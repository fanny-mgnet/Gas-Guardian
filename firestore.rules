/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Users can only
 * access their own profile information, devices, and alerts. There are no administrative
 * roles or shared access scenarios in this initial version.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is organized hierarchically under `/users/{userId}`, with devices stored in a
 * subcollection `/users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}` and alerts in
 * `/users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}`. This structure facilitates
 * owner-only access control.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create their own user document using their UID as the document ID.
 * - Users cannot list all users.
 * - All device and alert data is strictly owned by the user who created it.
 * - No public data access is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field is denormalized into both the `/devices` and `/alerts` documents to
 * simplify security rules and avoid costly `get()` calls. This allows direct ownership
 * checks at the device and alert level.
