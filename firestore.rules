/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Users can only
 * read and write data associated with their own user ID. This includes user profiles,
 * devices, and alerts. All write operations are validated against the authenticated
 * user's ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured hierarchically:
 * /users/{userId} - User profile information. Document ID matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId} - Devices owned by the user.
 * /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId} - Alerts generated by a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user document. Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Devices and alerts are nested under the user's document, ensuring ownership.
 * - The `userId` field is denormalized onto the Device and Alert documents, enabling
 *   efficient security rules without additional `get()` calls.
 * - No public data is exposed.
