/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 *  including their profile, devices, and alerts generated by those devices.
 * @data_structure Data is organized hierarchically under /users/{userId}. Each user has a profile document,
 *  a 'devices' subcollection, and an 'alerts' subcollection for each device.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is explicitly disallowed. All write operations are validated against
 *  the authenticated user's ID to prevent unauthorized data modification.  Data is denormalized such that `userId` is present on each document (User, Device, Alert),
 *  which simplifies and secures data access.  Timestamp validation is skipped in this prototyping phase.
 * @denormalization The `userId` field is included in both the Device and Alert entities to enable direct
 *  authorization checks without requiring additional reads.
 * @structural_segregation All user-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring
 *  clear separation and preventing accidental public exposure.
