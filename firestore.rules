/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Users can only
 * access their own profile information, devices, and alerts. No cross-user data access
 * is permitted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores devices owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts for a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized discovery of user accounts.
 * - All write operations require the user to be authenticated.
 * - Data consistency between document IDs and internal userId fields is enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `Alert` entity includes a `userId` field to simplify security rules and avoid
 * needing to traverse the data hierarchy to verify ownership.
