/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the SmartGas Guardian system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access
 * their own user profile and the devices and alerts associated with their account.
 * All data is nested under the /users/{userId} path to ensure clear ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alert information for a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user profile.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete devices associated with their account.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete alerts associated with their devices.
 * - Listing of top-level collections is disallowed to prevent unauthorized data discovery.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Device and Alert documents contain a `userId` field, which is used to verify ownership.
 *   This avoids the need for complex queries to determine ownership.
