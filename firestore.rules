/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for data access. Each user can only access
 * their own profile information, their registered devices, and the alerts generated by those devices.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. The {userId} must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information. Each device belongs to a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by a device. Each alert belongs to a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list their own devices and alerts.
 * - Users cannot list all users in the system.
 * - Data consistency between path and document fields is enforced on creation and updates.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The `userId` field is present on both `Device` and `Alert` documents. This allows us to avoid complex queries (or `get()` calls) to determine ownership.
