/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Users can only
 * access their own data, and devices/alerts are scoped to the owning user.
 * All write operations require a valid, authenticated user. Data validation
 * is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping but enforces key relationships
 * (e.g., userId) for authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.  Document ID is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Devices owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Alerts generated by a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All data is private and requires authentication.
 * - Ownership is enforced at every level (user, device, alert).
 * - Data validation is minimized for prototyping but essential relationships are enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field is denormalized into both the Device and Alert entities.
 * This avoids the need for complex `get()` operations to verify ownership.
