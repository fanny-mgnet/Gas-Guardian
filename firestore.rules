/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 * including their profile, devices, and alerts.  No cross-user data access is permitted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores devices owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only manage (create, update, delete) devices that they own.
 * - Users can only access alerts generated by their own devices.
 * - Listing the entire `users` collection is prohibited.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Device` and `Alert` documents contain a `userId` field that must match the user ID in the path. This is enforced on create and update to prevent orphaned or misattributed data.
