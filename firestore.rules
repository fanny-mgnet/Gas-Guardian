/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only access their own profile data,
 *   and they can only manage devices and alerts associated with their account. There is no administrative override.
 * @data_structure Data is nested under /users/{userId}, with devices and alerts as subcollections.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disallowed for privacy. Device and alert information is strictly controlled
 *   by user ownership. The system is designed to prevent any cross-user data access.
 * @denormalization Authorization relies on the `userId` field present in `Device` and `Alert` documents, which is
 *   compared against the authenticated user's `uid`.
