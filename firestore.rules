/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for devices and their associated alerts.
 * Users can only read and write data associated with their own devices and alerts.
 * Device registration is open to everyone, but subsequent modifications are restricted
 * to authenticated users/devices only. The user documents are owner-accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information.
 * - /devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by each device.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing all documents at the root level is explicitly denied. All list operations
 *   must be performed on user-scoped collections.
 * - Open device registration: Anyone can create a new `/devices/{deviceId}` document.
 *   However, updates are restricted to authenticated users, effectively making
 *   the creator the "owner" after registration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Alerts store the `deviceId` directly within their document to avoid needing to perform
 *   `get()` operations on the parent device document for authorization.
