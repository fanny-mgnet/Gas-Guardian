/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SmartGas Guardian.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for data access. Each user can only access
 * their own profile information, their registered devices, and the alerts generated by those devices.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores devices owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by a specific device.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data.
 * - Listing the root collection is denied to all users, addressing the error in the user's request.
 * - Data validation is relaxed for prototyping, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
 * - Denormalization: The `userId` field is included in the `Device` and `Alert` documents to
 *   enable efficient security rules without requiring complex queries.
