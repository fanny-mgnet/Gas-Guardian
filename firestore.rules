/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the SmartGas Guardian system.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with the document ID matching the user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts generated by each device.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only manage devices and alerts associated with their account.
 * - Listing the entire 'users' collection is disallowed for security reasons.
 * - All write operations require a valid authentication token.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal fields (userId) is enforced on create and update.
